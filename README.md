# Bocaj QMK Layout Workspace

This repo is a workspace that simplifies modifying my userspace and layouts from [qmk_firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/), it also has the advantage of being tracked separate from the main qmk_firmware fork -- making PRs upstream much less cumbersome.

## History

This is my 3rd major iteration at creating the perfect keymap. In all iterations I've drawn tons of inspiration from [@drashna's userspace](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/drashna) and his countless keymaps that utilize it. Admittedly, for a quicker jumping off point on this revision I used his userspace as a template and will gradually "trim the fat" (no offense meant, I just don't have nearly as many toys) and add my own. The major nuances will exist within my layers, navigation, and various subtleties with the layouts to match my particular workflow.
